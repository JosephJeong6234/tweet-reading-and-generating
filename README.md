# tweet-reading-and-generating
AI-generated-tweet allows users to generate new tweets on a specific topic by interacting with AI model. Instead of leveraging the power of ChatGPT to understand user inputs and generate relevant and coherent tweets, I try to build the pipeline of AI-generated-tweet from scratch. Users can provide a specific topic or query, and the AI model will generate tweet-like responses based on the input.
For data collection, I scraped tweets off of a twitter account and turned it into a pandas dataframe. Then I fed it into a deep learning model. The output of the model didnâ€™t really work that well due to the collected tweets being written by many different languages and also included emojis. For next steps, I will filter  the tweets with non-English and emojis. Then I will finetune the AI model to get a topic based on tweets. Then, AI model will be finetuned with a given topic to produce tweets.
